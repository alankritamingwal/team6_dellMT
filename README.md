Introducing our project, the **dell_MH**‚Äîa transformative solution in the field of mental health support. We aim to address the delays in traditional psychiatric and counseling services by providing early-stage assistance and effective interventions. Utilizing LLMs, the ChatPsychiatrist swiftly identifies individual issues and offers tailored treatment recommendations. With an adaptive communication style, it becomes a powerful and free tool to provide personalized mental health support to users in need.

This repo open-sources the Instruct-tuned LLaMA-7B model that has been fine-tuned with counseling domian instruction data. 
# DATA

# Data
### Data Source

The data used for this project comes from ~260 real conversations in counseling recordings (in English). The transcripts of these recordings were used as the primary source for building the training and testing datasets. These conversations cover a variety of topics, including *emotion*, *family*, *relationship*, *career development*, *academic stress*, etc. This figure below shows the distribution of mental health-related topics in Psych8K. (The inner circle represents 5 major categories, and the outer group represents minor topics)



### Data Processing

To build the dataset, we took the following steps:

1. **Transcription:** The counseling recordings were transcribed to obtain the raw textual data.

2. **Data Cleaning & Information Extraction:** The transcripts were cleaned to remove any irrelevant or sensitive information, ensuring that the data used for training and testing maintains privacy and ethical standards. Since single round conversations in real counseling recordings may contain limited information, we segmented transcripts into short conversations for further query-answer pair generation. 
3. **Query-Answer Pair Generation:** With the extracted short conversations, we then used the GPT-4 API to build the query-answer data. Each short conversation clip (i.e., each of ten round) text was used as the context, and GPT4 was prompted to generate the corresponding query and answer. In total, **8,187** query-answer pairs were produced.

    GPT4 generated a summary of the important information for each conversation. These summaries provided a higher level of context and detail that helps the model to understand and generate meaningful responses.

4. **Testing Data:** Another 100 quert-answer pairs were created using the same process as the training set. Topics covered include: *Addiction, Anger, Anxiety, Bereavement, Culture, Depression, Eating_Disorders, Family, Fear, Illness, LGBTQ, Pain, Perfectionism and Stress*.

### Data Examples

The following table contains four samples from different topics, with the user providing the query and the psychiatrist providing the feedback.

<font size=0.5>

| User's Query  | Psychiatrist's Feedback   | Topic   |
| -- | -- | --|
| I expect myself to earn A's, and when my work doesn't pull through, I feel like there's something that I did wrong. Sometimes, I even question if I'm fit to be a grad student. I've done consistently well, but I still feel like next semester might be a disaster and make me realize that coming to grad school was a bad decision. | It seems like you feel that an A is the only acceptable grade, and anything less makes you question your abilities. This can create a tremendous amount of pressure and fear about not being good enough. It's important to recognize that these feelings are normal, but they shouldn't dictate your self-worth. Remember that every student experiences setbacks, and it doesn't mean that you aren't fit for grad school. Can you think of any specific instances where you bounced back from a less-than-perfect grade or performance?            | **Academic Stress** |
| Lately, I've been feeling highly stressed and under a lot of pressure. I'm finding it difficult to deal with, but somehow, I want to rise up and be able to return to my normal self in these situations and find a way to get the stress out.                                                                                          | I understand that you are experiencing stress and pressure, and it's great that you want to cope with it in a healthy way. First, try to identify the main source of your stress and work on eliminating or reducing it. Practice relaxation techniques like mindfulness, meditation, or deep breathing exercises to help manage your stress. Also, don't forget to make time for yourself and engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.                                                                                                |        **Anxiety**         |
| I always get upset when my husband comes in 30 minutes late, but now I know the reason behind it. I want to try and not get upset the next time this happens.                                                                                                                                                                        | It's great that you've gained some understanding about the situation. Instead of getting upset, focus on reacting calmly and setting healthy boundaries. You can communicate your expectations clearly and reinforce them with actions. If you feel the need to try, it's important to fully commit to yourself and practice patience while working on it.                                                                                                                                                                                            |        **Family**         |
| I don't know if I evade, or it's my protection mechanisms, but when anyone puts me down or acts badly to me and I cannot stop them, I feel weak. I know I should take a deep breath and remind myself that I'm a good person, but still, it causes so much conflict.                                                                    | It's normal to feel upset when people put you down or treat you poorly. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries and protect yourself. Sometimes people feel weak in such situations because they haven't developed their assertiveness skills. You can practice techniques like using 'I' statements to express your feelings, and setting boundaries with those who mistreat you. Just remember that self-compassion and self-care are important when dealing with conflicts. Are there any specific situations where you struggle to assert yourself? |          **Relationship**       |
